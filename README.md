# calculator


Simple Calculator using switch

This program takes choice for an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /) and two operands from an user and performs the operation on those two operands depending upon the operator entered by user and then display the result. 

The switch and break statement is used to create a calculator. The operator choice is stored in variable choice and two operands are stored in x and y respectively.

Then switch case statement is used for checking the operator entered by user.

If user enters + then, statements for case: 1 is executed and program is terminated.

If user enters - then, statements for case: 2 is executed and program is terminated.

This program works similarly for * and / operator. 

There are 2 different methods for taking 2 operands and 4 different methods for each operation ( =, -, *, / )

Happy Coding :)
